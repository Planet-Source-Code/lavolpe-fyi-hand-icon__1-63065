## FYI: Hand Icon


</div>

### Description

We all know the hand icon is not available as a MousePointer option. Most of us know how to use LoadCursorFromFile so we can use a hand icon. This is a minor spin on that age-old procedure. What if user has a mouse theme going, wouldn't it be cool to show the hand of that theme instead of some static icon you have in your RES file? There are 2 similar examples shown in this project on how to accomplish this.
